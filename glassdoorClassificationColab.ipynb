        "This notebook experiments with different methods for classifying employee reviews. The goal is to identify reviews that talk about the epistemic virtues and vices of the organizations reviewers work at, such as curiosity, intellectual courage, epistemic vigilance etc. on the virtue side, and epistemic malevolence, indifference, closed-mindedness etx. on the vice side. Moreover, The notebook also experiments with different approaches to extract text features based on the classification, e.g. dictionaries. \n",

        "- I wonder whether we are using HuggingFace inefficiently. I configured the zero-shot classifier to use batches of 5, and there is some parallelization built into the standard configuration, but I have not really gotten to the bottom of what the Dataset object is capable of. Not even sure we are using the GPU, or go more or less sequentially. Fixing this would speed up the classification tasks."
